    `If you are a resident in France you are obliged to submit a tax return and declare your worldwide income, even if it has already been taxed abroad.`,
    `If you are a resident in France with a state pension, private sector pension, or annuity from the UK, it is taxable in France. Any income from interests or dividends are taxable in France.`,
    `Initially, for those from the UK, when you relocate to France you will be taxed at source by HM Revenue and Customs. You will later need to make an application to be taxed in France and to receive a rebate of tax paid in the UK.`,
    `If you own a holiday home that you rent out but do not live in France you may be liable for French income tax although non-residents will only be assessed on the basis of income actually earned in France.`,
    `You must submit a return if you are non-resident but have earnings from France. This rule applies even though you may be below the income threshold for liability to French income tax.`,
    `The extent of your liability will depend on the type of income you earn in France and the terms of any double taxation treaty between your home country and France.`,
    `These tax treaties have been developed in order to avoid a situation where the same income is taxed twice, and to determine the rights of taxation between two countries.`,

    `Today French income tax is assessed in arrears, so your tax declaration for 2018 will cover your earnings for the calendar year ending 2017.`,
    `There is no PAYE (pay as you earn) system although plans are made to introduce it from 2019.`,
    `The precise closing date for declarations each year varies depending on where you live and if it is a paper or on line declaration but is always at the end of May or early June.`,
    `The amount due will be communicated to you (avis d’impôt) sometime during August or September or earlier if your declaration was done on line.`,
    `The payments for the first year are due in one lump sum; after that you can opt for paying by monthly direct debit, or in three instalments either by an on-line single payment, or by direct debit`,
