    `This is an annual residence tax paid by the occupier of a property in which they were resident on 1st January of each year. (if you rent out your property on a long or short term period the renter pays this tax – this does not apply to holiday rentals)`,
    `If the property is your second home and even if you are not in residence on January 1st the tax is still payable. (unless the house is under renovation and inhabitable)`,
    `The determination of the amount payable is made by the local council (commune), but the calculation and collection of the tax is carried out by the central government tax authority.`,
    `The tax demand is sent out during the third quarter of the year with a deadline for payment in November or December unless you opt to pay on a monthly or annual basis by direct debit.`,
