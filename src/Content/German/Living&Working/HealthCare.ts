      question: "Do you need top up health insurance?",
      answer: [
        "The health service cover in France for routine treatment pays a percentage of your medical costs and the percentage level of reimbursement will vary depending on the type of treatment received and from whom.",
        "Seeing a doctor and basic health care fees and reimbursement levels are fairly straightforward, but specialist services can get a little more complicated and expensive.",
        "The social security system will normally pay for about 70% of official doctor fees and 65% of prescribed medication under condition that you have registered with a GP (déclaration de médecin traitant)",
        "The level and scope of reimbursement depends on the type of treatment, the type of illness, your circumstances, and the cause of the illness.",
        "If you want to be fully insured and have the majority of your fees and costs reimbursed, then you will need to take out a top-up health insurance.",
        "Top up health insurance will pay most, but not all, of the residual costs of medical care, so you will still be left with a small amount to pay yourself. The amount will depend on your policy, your circumstances, and the nature of your treatment.",
        "You need to determine the level of cover you seek and pay the appropriate premium.",
